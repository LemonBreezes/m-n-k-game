This is a version of Tic Tac Toe where the grid size, winning line length, and
number of human/AI players can be set by the user. Currently, the only way to
set values for these parameters is by manually editing ~main.py~. A perfect AI has
been implemented using the minimax algorithm but is too slow for boards larger
than 3x3 because alpha beta pruning has not been implemented. Currently, the
game is playable only from the command line.

To install and run this game
manually, run:
#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/LemonBreezes/python-tic-tac-toe
cd python-tic-tac-toe
python main.py
#+end_src
