This project is a work in progress. A perfect AI has been implemented using the
minimax algorithm but is too slow for boards larger than 3x3 (3x4 if you wait a
few minutes for the first move) because alpha beta pruning has not been
implemented.

To install and run this game
manually, run:
#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/LemonBreezes/m-n-k-game
cd m-n-k-game
python main.py
#+end_src
