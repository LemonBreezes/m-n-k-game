This is a version of Tic Tac Toe where the grid size and winning line length can
be set by the user. Currently, the only way to set values for these parameters
is by manually editing ~main.py~. A perfect AI has been implemented using the
minimax algorithm but is too slow for boards larger than 3x3 because no
heuristics have been implemented.

To install and run this game
manually, run:
#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/LemonBreezes/python-tic-tac-toe
cd python-tic-tac-toe
python main.py
#+end_src
