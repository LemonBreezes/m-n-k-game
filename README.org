You can set the length and with of the game board with the ~-r~ and ~-c~ options as
follows:
#+begin_src sh
python main.py -r 3 -c 4
#+end_src
Setting the length or width greater than 4 is not recommended for performance
reasons. The length and width both default to 4.

You can also set the amount of tiles a player needs to align in order to win by
using the ~-w~ flag:
#+begin_src sh
python main.py -w 3
#+end_src
This parameter defaults to 3. Increasing this parameter is not recommended for
performance reasons.

If you would like to watch two AIs play against each other, use the ~-ai~ flag:
#+begin_src sh
python main.py -ai
#+end_src

Similarly, if you would like to play the game from the command line interface
instead of the graphical interface, use the ~-nw~ flag:
#+begin_src sh
python main.py -nw
#+end_src

If you would like to set which player goes first, set the ~-o~ flag:
#+begin_src sh
python main.py -o 1
#+end_src
Set this parameter to 1 if you would like to go first or 2 if you would like the
AI to go first. This parameter defaults to -1, indicating that
the opening player will be randomly chosen.
